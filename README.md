# kubernetes-practice
As part of learning Kubernetes, I tried to run Jenkins as a pod with a persistent volume. This practice was done using Minikube, which runs as a Docker container.
Currently, Jenkins is running as a single pod without any replicas. However, I plan to scale it up to run on 2-3 pods simultaneously. Additionally, I am planning to create Jenkins slave nodes using pods.
